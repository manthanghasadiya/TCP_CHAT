# TCP_CHAT

This is just a basic TCP-chat that I created. 

First you will have to run TCP_server.py 
> python3 TCP_server.py

And then run TCP_client.py
> python3 TCP_client.py

you will see the output like this 

[+] Listening on 0.0.0.0:9997
[+] Accepted connection from 127.0.0.1: 42912
[+] Received: hello
